# phryctoria
Implementation of the semaphore system of communication used in ancient Greece

Background: The phryctoria were towers built on selected mountaintops so that one tower (phryctoria) would be visible to the next tower (usually 20 miles away). The towers were used for the transmission of a specific prearranged message. Flames were lit on one tower and then the next tower in succession also lit flames.

Code: After user input of a message we get an output of how many "torches" each side would have for each letter of the message.
For this we are using a 6x5 system to encode the 26 letters of the english alphabet instead of a 5x5 system used for the greek letters.

How to run: 
- Using Visual Code run the html on a live server
- Input your message in the text box
- Open the console and check the output
